# karabiner-elements-terminal-navigation

This is apparently no longer hosted on the karabiner elements site so I'm uploading it here.

On the website it was listed as maintained by [`marlonrichert`](https://github.com/marlonrichert) so I'm guessing these shortcuts were originally created by them.

# Usage

1. Drag the `.json` file into `!/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/`
2. Open Karabiner Elements
3. Navigate to the `Complex modifications` tab
4. Click `+ Add rule` in the bottom right
5. There should be a new list populated called `Navigation in Terminal Apps`
6. Add rules to your hearts content!
